Web-MOFSynth is an online tool for **MOF synthesizability evaluation**, with
emphasis on reticular chemistry.

In materials science, especially in the synthesis of metal-organic frameworks (MOFs),
a significant portion of time and effort is spent on the experimental process of synthesizing
and evaluating the viability of MOFs.

Web-MOFSynth aims to provide a simple and efficient interface for evaluating
the synthesizability of metal-organic frameworks in an experiment-ready format,
minimizing the time and labor traditionally required for these experimental preprocessing steps.
This allows researchers to focus more on innovative synthesis and experimental validation
rather than on preparatory tasks.
